# Revised Project Structure

**sisovin**: Created in Vite React, Node.js and MongoDB using argon2 (password, hash and refresh token), soft-delete Design, Redis (caching), tailwind CSS 4 for a full freelance platform website where you can hire experts to get your job done. Or, if you are a skilled person, you can find work there. This full freelance platform website features:
✔️ Installer step-by-step guide 🤹🏻‍♂️
✔️ User Registration and Profile 🙋🏻‍♂️
✔️ Social Network Posts 📝
✔️ Pages 📃
✔️ Groups 🥳
✔️ Media 📂
✔️ Friends 🙏🏻
✔️ Realtime Chat (end-to-end encrypted)💬
✔️ Job Portal 👨🏻‍🔧 👨🏻‍🍳 👩🏻‍🏫 👩🏻‍🎨
✔️ Admin Panel 👨🏻‍💼
✔️ User Dashboard
✔️ Blogs 📜
✔️ Page Builder 🏗
✔️ Freelance Platform (multi-purpose platform project)  👨🏻‍💻 🤑

**GitHub Copilot**: I notice there's a mismatch between your current backend folder structure and the freelance platform features you described. The existing structure seems designed for a different type of application (possibly a financial tracking app), with routes and controllers for transactions, goals, and financial reports.

Let me propose an updated folder structure that better aligns with your freelance platform requirements:
